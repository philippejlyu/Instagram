# Instant Gram [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/philippejlyu/Instagram.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/philippejlyu/Instagram)
This is my demo app Instant Gram.
In the main feed, images are downloaded from various websites. (404 errors may happen as a result)
The image feed is taken from a json file.

## Images.json
images.json is stored in the repsitory because this is where it is being parsed from. It can be deleted from the project once you download it if you want. It is not necessary
